# AndroidTripGen
Android generator of tripcodes for imageboards like syn-ch.org etc

Used this https://github.com/ChaosData/TripGen for getting tripcodes from passwrds

Accepts kotlin regex https://zetcode.com/kotlin/regularexpressions/ for requested trips

Seems to be quite slow, but better than nothing i guess
